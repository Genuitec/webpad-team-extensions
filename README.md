# Team Extensions by WebPad

[Team Extensions for Brackets](https://www.genuitec.com/products/webpad/teamext/) is the first in a suite of WebPad extensions. You need your team of web developers and designers to keep their Brackets setup in sync with specific extensions used for a project. Team Extensions makes it easy to communicate and install required team project extensions. Ready, set, code!

At [Genuitec](https://www.genuitec.com/), we are a fan of Brackets for front-end web development. [WebPad](https://www.genuitec.com/products/webpad/) is shaping up to be a suite of Brackets extensions that make web development easier. Our first free entry into this suite is Team Extensions by WebPad. Follow @WebPadDev on Twitter to keep up with what’s new!

For your team to receive notification of required extensions for a project, link up each member’s system via a Team Extensions file added to your version control system (VCS).

1. Have all team members install Team Extensions by WebPad.
2. Add the generated .team.extensions file to your version control system. The file is located in the root of your project.

Team Extensions manages Brackets extensions on a per project basis. Be sure to add the .team.extensions file to your VCS each time you begin a new project.

## 3. Set Required Extensions for Your Project

2. Click the Team tab, and click the manage link.

Note: You can get quick access for managing your team extensions by selecting Team>Manage Extensions from the main menu.

## 4. Install Required Extensions

When an extension is added by a team member as a tracked extension, all team members receive a status bar notification that a new extension is required.

1. Select File>Extension Manager, and click the Team tab.
2. Click Install All, or click Install beside an individual extension.
3. Click Close.

When a team project extension is installed, the Install button changes to Installed. Therefore, all team project extensions continue to appear on the Team tab.
